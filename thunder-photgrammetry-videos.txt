A meticulously crafted 360-degree photogrammetry sequence, capturing every 60-degree angle, seamlessly integrates any provided artifact input image. Each step enhances and accurately renders the front view, ensuring consistency across all sides. The process culminates in a flawlessly designed 3D object, adorned with realistic textures derived from the input image. Every side mirrors the same intricate design, resulting in a cohesive, solid, and visually stunning 3D model that perfectly aligns with the original input, showcasing a harmonious blend of technology and artistry. The sequence begins with a detailed close-up of the artifact, transitions through each 60-degree rotation with precision, and concludes with a rotating display of the final 3D model. Vibrant lightning sparks in red and green illuminate the boundary of the statue, casting bright, dynamic flashes that accentuate its contours. The warm, natural light of mid-afternoon bathes the model, enhancing its textures and details, while the electrifying hues create a striking give an correct model and surrounded by thunder red green and blue lightening at its contour
