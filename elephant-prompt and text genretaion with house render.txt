Create a high-quality 3D-rendered video showcasing a modern house surrounded by a lush, well-manicured garden with warm ambient lighting. The house should feature contemporary architecture with clean lines, large glass panels, and a seamless integration of indoor and outdoor spaces. The garden should be abundant with greenery, including neatly trimmed grass, elegant landscaping, and clean, curved stone pathways.

At the center of one garden path, place a detailed black stone elephant artifact from the provided input image. The elephant should be modeled in 3D with accurate proportions and intricate details, blending aesthetically into the scene. It should sit naturally within the landscape, accented by soft sunlight and subtle garden lighting, making it a focal point.

The video begins with a close-up of the elephant artifact, capturing its texture and craftsmanship. As the camera smoothly rotates around the house, the elephant should appear in different positions for one second each—such as beside a water feature, near a garden bench, or in a circular pathway—before settling at its central position. The rotation showcases the house’s front, sides, and rear, highlighting the harmony between architecture and nature.

Lighting plays a crucial role, with golden-hour sunlight casting soft shadows, and reflections adding depth and realism. The final panoramic view integrates the house, garden, and elephant artifact, emphasizing the tranquility and sophistication of the entire scene. The aesthetic balance should radiate warmth and modern elegance, with DSLR-quality rendering and smooth camera movements in a 6-second video. show the elephant as artifact
